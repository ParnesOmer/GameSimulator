print                   - Display status of all vehicles and warehouses
go                      - Advance simulation time by one hour

VEHICLE CREATION
----------------

Create a state trooper:
create trooper1 State_trooper Frankfurt

Create a chopper:
create c1 Chopper (10,15)

MAP CONTROLS
------------

default                 - Reset map to default settings
size 20                 - Set map size (range: 7-30)
zoom 3.5                - Adjust zoom level

- Vehicle names must be 12 characters or less
- Choppers require speed parameter for course and position commands
- Only choppers can perform attacks on trucks
- Only choppers and state troopers support destination commands
- All coordinates are specified in kilometers
- Simulation time advances in 1-hour increments
